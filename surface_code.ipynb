        "Implementing a rotated surface code, as far as I understand it:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Initialize qubits\n",
        "   - Define grid size for a rotated surface code of distance d.\n",
        "     - This means the number of data qubits (physical non-ancilla qubits) is d^2.\n",
        "     - 3x3 grid ==> 9 data qubits.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Create a lattice:\n",
        "   - Let each qubit be a vertex in a d×d grid.\n",
        "   - Assign a qubit to each of the vertices on the grid.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Initialize the logical qubit:\n",
        "   - Apply a **logical \\(X\\)** and/or **logical \\(Z\\)** operator to encode the logical qubit (e.g., by applying a chain of qubits across rows and columns).\n",
        "    - I'm not suuuuper clear on the nitty gritty of this part...but I imagine we can use the same circuits as the toric code paper? Should be fine as long as we keep track of boundary conditions\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Apply stabilizer measurements (star and plaquette):\n",
        "   - A star stabilizer acts on a qubit and its neighboring qubits (connected to a vertex).\n",
        "   - A plaquette stabilizer acts on four qubits in a square arrangement.\n",
        "   - Apply each stabilizer by measuring the state of neighboring qubits:\n",
        "     - For each **plaquette stabilizer**:\n",
        "       - Measure the parity of four qubits that form a square (e.g., top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right of a plaquette).\n",
        "     - For each **star stabilizer**:\n",
        "       - Measure the parity of four qubits connected to a vertex.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Syndrome measurement:\n",
        "   - Measure the stabilizers (parity of qubits) to detect errors.\n",
        "   - If the syndrome indicates an error (for example, a flipped bit), you can to correct the error by applying the appropriate gate\n",
        "   - Store the syndrome outcome (e.g., which stabilizers detected an error)\n",
        "   - Do we want to do this Pauli frame stuff? That would go here ish\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Error correction (move this to later if we do PF):\n",
        "   - If the syndrome indicates a flipped bit or phase, apply a correction based on the syndrome information\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Iterate:\n",
        "   - Repeat the process for each time step until the logical qubit is read out with high fidelity.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Logical qubit measurement:\n",
        "   - PF corrections go here if we do that.\n",
        "   - Once error correction is complete, measure the logical qubit to extract the result.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Return the result:\n",
        "   - The final measurement outcome is the state of the logical qubit after the error correction process.\n",
